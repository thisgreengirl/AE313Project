This project is for the AE313 Class at ERAU in Spring 2024
The purpose of the project is to compare two types of orbit transfers, the Hohmann Transfer and the Bielliptic Transfer
The main program accesses the two UDFs for orbit visualization.

In order to view the figures correctly, the main program has to be run twice, or the curves won't show up properly. (I can't figure out why)
Download the main file and the two functions.
Run the main program once.
DO NOT close the figures
Run the main program a second time.
Analyze the figures provided and the command line answers
